New Bridge created at address: 0xa59234983001157BCd2221B2c5b43509B74B768D
Nothing to compile
No need to generate any newer typings.
DEPRECATION WARNING: 'hardhat-etherscan' has been deprecated in favor of 'hardhat-verify'. You can find more information about the migration in the readme.
Verification for Bridge failed with the following error: More than one contract was found to match the deployed bytecode.
Please use the contract parameter with one of the following contracts:
  * src/bridge/Bridge.sol:Bridge
  * src/mocks/BridgeUnproxied.sol:BridgeUnproxied

For example:

  hardhat verify --contract contracts/Example.sol:ExampleContract <other args>

If you are running the verify subtask from within Hardhat instead:

  await run("verify:verify", {
    <other args>,
    contract: "contracts/Example.sol:ExampleContract"
  };

New Inbox created at address: 0xC2b25BDA0d8A79Fc5468D35aB4150BF162A996d8
Nothing to compile

DEPRECATION WARNING: 'hardhat-etherscan' has been deprecated in favor of 'hardhat-verify'. You can find more information about the migration in the readme.
Verification for Inbox failed with the following error: Failed to send contract verification request.
Endpoint URL: https://api.basescan.org/api
Reason: The Etherscan API responded that the address 0xC2b25BDA0d8A79Fc5468D35aB4150BF162A996d8 does not have bytecode.
This can happen if the contract was recently deployed and this fact hasn't propagated to the backend yet.
Try waiting for a minute before verifying your contract. If you are invoking this from a script,
try to wait for five confirmations of your contract deployment transaction before running the verification subtask.
