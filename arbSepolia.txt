New Bridge created at address: 0x88c3D778D87a96769Bb6C93B25Ef0a2684EE4766
Nothing to compile
No need to generate any newer typings.
DEPRECATION WARNING: 'hardhat-etherscan' has been deprecated in favor of 'hardhat-verify'. You can find more information about the migration in the readme.
Verification for Bridge failed with the following error: More than one contract was found to match the deployed bytecode.
Please use the contract parameter with one of the following contracts:
  * src/bridge/Bridge.sol:Bridge
  * src/mocks/BridgeUnproxied.sol:BridgeUnproxied

For example:

  hardhat verify --contract contracts/Example.sol:ExampleContract <other args>

If you are running the verify subtask from within Hardhat instead:

  await run("verify:verify", {
    <other args>,
    contract: "contracts/Example.sol:ExampleContract"
